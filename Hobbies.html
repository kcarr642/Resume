<h1>Hobbies</h1>
<h2> Driven to Learn and Explore</h2>
<p>I'm driven by a life-long hunger for learning this is present in both my professional and personal life.</p>
<p>I am learning how to speak spanish with the goal of becoming fluent.</p>
<p>I am currently taking a Web Development Bootcamp course through Udemy which is how I've learned to make this resume</p>
<p>I am writing a fiction book and I ran a creative writing club for years back home.</p>
<p>I am currently living away from my native country of Canada abroad in England as to see more of the world.</p>
<p>Back in Canada, you'd be most likely to find me in the mountains hiking or snowboarding.</p>
